# Claude Code Instructions

## Progress Narration

- Always narrate what you're about to do before each tool call (e.g., "Reading the invoice store to check the schema...")
- After completing a step, briefly state what you found or did before moving on
- Use TodoWrite for any task with more than 2 steps, updating status in real-time
